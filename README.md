# Python Bundle
Simple set of packages to be used in Python apps

# Disclaimer
This is a constant work in progress and do not intend to be a state-of-the-art. I just like to code my own approaches and this repo is meant for me to reuse them.

Suggestions are welcome :)

# How to use it
In your own Python project,
1. Open the `requirements.txt` file and add (update with the preferred tag, check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)):
```
git+https://github.com/XaviArnaus/python-bundle@v0.0.5
```
2. Save, close and execute:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
